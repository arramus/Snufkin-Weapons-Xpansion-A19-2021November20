20th of November 2021 - Snufkin Weapons Xpansion (A19)
======================================================

The Snufkin Weapons Xpansion is a server side mod which exploits regular game code to make customised weapons and mods in the form of hats and clothing that fit in the hat colour slot.
It restores the original base of Snufkin's Server Side WeaponS and adds its own special additions.

Restoration and expansion has been a momentous task and there are still a few small issues for the player to contend with. For example, it is sometimes necessary to remove and re-add the weapon to your toolbelt should some of the weapon visuals dissapear or look out of place.

Slawa and oakraven have been there from the beginning with the base mod restoration, but in this Xpansion Mod, oakraven has taken the lead and branched out with A19 base mod restoration and additional weapons.

There are untold changes that needed to be implemeted for the A19 build and they will not be listed here. However, you can always compare the A18 build with the A19 build if you wish to make a comparison.

============
INSTALLATION
============
For players and server hosts who have never installed a mod before.
If you've never installed a mod before it is necessary to create a mod folder in the main directory or in an area suggested by your server host if they have modified the installation. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature). If you drag the mod folder directly out of the zipped file it can be placed directly into the Mods folder and the game will look in there as you launch your World. If you allow your unzip function to extract the folder, it may make another unnecessary folder and place the mod inside it. This will not be recognised by the game/server if you place it in the Mods folder like this. Please take it out of the extra folder level. The top layer will be a single folder and in the second layer you will see a ModInfo.xml file with or without additional folders depending on the mod. This will become elementary once you've launched a few mods.

Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES
Do players also need to install this Mod? = NO

The magic of this mod is that is only needs to be installed in the server/person who has launched the main environment that others join. It is a technical work of art. Enjoy.

CREDITS
=======
Apart from Snufkin who created the base mod, oakraven has been critical to its success. Slawa has been there from the beginning with the base mod support and ShoudenKalferas has also joined the venture. In addition, players and server hosts have been fundamental to development with their own testing and feedback without which progression would have been restricted. These include, but are not limited to: Dre who has assisted with extensive feedback, PeNa1979 for playtesting new recipes and offering probability feedback, Catman at ZombieShack for stress testing with an abundace of other mods, and Tigger at Geek Gaming for testing his own hybrid integrations. arramus' role has simply been to support QC, PR, update coding to the most recent build, and comprehensive inclusion coding for the Xpansion weapons. All of this support allowed the Snufkin Weapons Xpansion Mod to move out of test phase to stable.
